    When I was a founder/CEO and responsible for raising capital, I felt enormous anxiety trying to get a single deck right. I would get feedback and iterate, feedback and iterate, and try to cram every good idea into a deck that was supposedly supposed to be twelve slides or less. It was only when I realized that there are three decks, one for each purpose — one to Get the Meeting (GM), one for In the Meeting(IM) with a Comprehensive Appendix (CA), one for After the Meeting (AM) — that the feedback and iteration felt like it was getting somewhere special.  
    So, if we’re working together I want to see three decks, not one. If you’re trying to get my attention, send me your GM deck. If I can make the time, show me your IM deck. And then if I want to process it internally, send me your AM deck. Deal?
