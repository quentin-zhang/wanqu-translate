  
I happen to use OneNote a lot recently, mainly for storing my handwritten notes thanks to the pretty accurate OCR feature.
  
    
Then I realize, there's also a great usage of OCR in OneNote other than just saving notes, it's: building an electronic index for all of your physical book.
  
    
How?
  
    
For me, I use Office Lens on my phone and OneNote for OCR. But it's okay to use Scannable/Evernote, and their OCR is well enough to recognize printed texts.
  
    
OK, but why?
  
    
Every time I tried to look up something, I have to search the index page and table of contents manually. Page by page, for every book on your bookshelf, such a PITA. Are you not believe me? Let's say you have five algorithms books, and you want to find out which book as a definition about k-d tree. Can you feel the pain?
  
    
Here's how I look it up:
  
    
  
    
Just half a second and I know I should open The Algorithm Design Manual book, and go to page 581 to read about k-d tree.
  
    
And the search result is limited to just my books, not the whole internet, that's the point of scanning instead of Googling.
  
    
I feel more confident to buy more books and throw them at my bookshelf now :P
