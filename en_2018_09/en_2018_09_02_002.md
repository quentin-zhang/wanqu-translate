    I've been working on TypeScript for over two years now(!) so I thought
I'd write a post or two to reflect.  I should open with the standard
disclaimer: I am just a random engineer at a company with tens of
thousands of them, and others surely disagree with the opinions
expressed here.  
    Google embraced web applications early.  Can you believe it's been 14
years since Gmail was released?  JavaScript back then was pure
madness.  Gmail engineers had to worry so much about Internet
Explorer's poor garbage collection algorithm that they'd need to
manually hoist string literals out of for loops to avoid GC pauses.  I
recently found a design doc from that era where they considered doing
what today we'd call "minifying" the JavaScript but noted that some
candidate tools were Windows-only.  Today that feels unimaginable.  
    Over those years Google built lots of infrastructure for making big
JavaScript apps.  For example, there's a module system to let source
files express their interdependencies.  There's a bundler that
combines and minifies source files into browser-compatible artifacts.
Another piece analyzes an app's dependency graph by
dynamically-loadable entry points and factors out common subset chunks
for serving.  Server-side rendering is common.  All of these concepts
are familiar to a web developer today but Google's stack predates
today's, evolved in parallel, and is consequently conceptually similar
but concretely totally different, with different processes, tools, and
even names for these ideas.  
    In another example of parallel evolution, each of Google, Facebook,
and Microsoft built similar but incompatible compilers that add static
checks to JavaScript.  Google's compiler is colloquially called
Closure. (Not to be confused with the Clojure language; for extra
confusion note that ClojureScript uses the Closure compiler.)  
    Google's JavaScript stack is unevenly great.  It has enabled Google to
write and maintain web apps that have changed the face of the
internet.  (Remember how amazing Maps was when it came out?  Today it
seems boringly obvious to make a draggy map widget.)  There are pieces
of it that surpass the best of today's technologies.  For example, the
Closure compiler is perhaps still the most sophisticated JavaScript
optimizer, able to do things like optimize code using type
information, inline functions across hot-loading chunk boundaries, and
strip unused code down to individual
symbols.  
    Google's JavaScript stack also has problems.  The incremental
evolution from a linter means Closure is a statically typed variant of
JavaScript where language features are introduced in comments.
Closure has unpredictable semantics, it's slow, it's buggy, and it
tends to mangle your code unless you hold it just right.  Though it is
open source, perhaps because of these reasons it isn't widely used in
the industry except at companies that hire Googlers who are familiar
with it.  Within Google I think JavaScript has a low reputation in
part because of our finicky tools, which combine the verbosity of a
static language with the unpredictability of a dynamic one.  
    Meanwhile, outside of Google, JavaScript also continued to evolve and
surprisingly even became popular.  In part to work around those IE
garbage collection bugs we built Chrome which led to v8 which led to
nodejs which means most web tools today are themselves written in
JavaScript, unlike the Java used to build this sort of tool at Google.
Module systems (UMD, AMD, CommonJS) proliferated.  (ES6 also came
along and invented its own module system that is incompatible with all
the others for some reason, sigh.)  npm unified the way tools and
libraries are shared.  Webpack can dynamically swap
modules into
a running application while you develop it.  
    Google uses none of this.  Experienced webdevs show up at Google and
it's like visiting an alternative timeline.  There's a CSS
preprocessing language like SASS but it's not SASS and nobody likes
it.  The fancy chunk-splitter doesn't really support third-party
JavaScript libraries in part because the tools predate the existence
of a JavaScript library ecosystem.  
    That's all just history.  You can argue we shouldn't have gotten to
this place but it doesn't change that we're here now.  Instead the
interesting question is: where do we go now?  There are a few options.
My perspective is surely biased by the one I prefer.  
    The first tempting option is to just abandon this ruined planet and
settle a new one that doesn't even involve JavaScript.  If only we
invested more in GWT (a Google project that compiles Java to
JavaScript) or Dart (a Google project that compiles a new language to
JavaScript) or WASM or [insert your favorite language here — Clojure?
Haxe? Elm?] we wouldn't need to worry about JavaScript at all!  
    As a PL enthusiast I'm pretty fond of this idea.  I'd like to give it
the careful analysis it deserves, but this post is long enough and I
think that discussion would work as its own post.  Instead of a full
refutation, here are some mundane concerns: adopting a different
language (1) does nothing for the literally millions of lines of
existing code we have — "rewrite from scratch in a new language" is
the correct choice for some situations, but it's a hard argument to make
as the best use of gmail engineers' time — and (2) it does little for
the aforementioned experienced frontend programmers that we would
like to hire.  
    The opposite of rewriting everything is to change nothing.  The public
JavaScript world, you could correctly point out, is full of amateur
code and leftpad disasters.  A good engineer can always adapt to our
idiosyncratic way of making frontends and we can always improve or
build more of own tools.  I am sympathetic to this view.  I think
there's a point in the space of tradeoffs where it makes sense to
build our own tools, and another point at which we've diverged so far
from the mainstream that our tools are a liability.  The argument is
then about where we are in that space, and I believe we're drifted too
far towards the latter.  We benefit from contributing to LLVM/Clang
because we depend on C++, but we wouldn't get much additional value
from building our own LLVM.  
    Which leads me to the middle path, which my little team has been
pursuing: incrementally adopt some external tooling where it makes
sense, by figuring out how to make it interoperate with our existing
code base.  This task isn't as fun — we don't get to just throw away
our legacy mess and "do it right this time" — but I like to think
rather more humble, looking outward rather than inward.  
    The first part of our bridge from the Google JavaScript Galapagos back
to the mainland was adopting a well-supported static checker that is
(1) not home-grown; (2) popular already, while similar to our existing
code; (3) designed to bridge into JavaScript; (4) designed to support
the large-scale development that motivated our custom tools in the
first place.  And that tool is TypeScript.  The strength of the
Closure compiler is its optimized output, while TypeScript has a great
user interface and no optimization at all.  The two tools are
complementary and (with some work) can be layered together.  
    Because TypeScript already mostly works — that's part of the reason
to adopt it, after all — we get many of the benefits of adopting an
established language, from IDE-style code completion to being able to
check StackOverflow for answers.  The work that's left for us has
primarily been integration: allowing our apps to incrementally move
into TypeScript without rewriting from scratch.  Our integration into
the Google-wide build
system is careful to
compile incrementally, which is critical for large apps; changes in
one module that don't affect its exported API don't cause downstream
modules to recompile.  Our integration into the Closure type/module
system means that ES6 TypeScript modules can import
Google-module-system modules and
the reverse, with (much of) the
type information preserved. One company successfully used the tools
we
published
to automatically translate their entire code base while preserving
their minified output.  
    Within Google TypeScript is now found in varying quantities
everywhere; it's likely if you use Google products you've interacted
with some TypeScript code.  TypeScript itself is a bunch of
interesting compromises, balancing a statically typed programming
language against the free-wheeling JavaScript ecosystem.  But that's
what we engineers do: we make interesting compromises that attempt to
balance different concerns.  I hope to write more in the future about
some of interesting corners we've discovered over the years.  As I
wrote when we first started down this
path,
I think TypeScript makes good tradeoffs within the design space.
