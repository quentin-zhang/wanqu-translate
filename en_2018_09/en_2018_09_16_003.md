    6 months ago I analyzed the version 66.0 of the Facebook.app for iOS:
https://blog.timac.org/2016/1018-analysis-of-the-facebook-app-for-ios  
    The version 66.0 was a 165 MB app on an iPad Air 2 (64-bit). It was a monolithic app with its main binary being more than 100 MB.  
    The version 87.0 is now available: 253 MB on the same iPad Air 2 with only 64-bit code. In just 6 months, the Facebook.app size grew by 88 MB!  
      
    Let’s see what changed…  
    Looking at the app content of the version 87.0 using GrandPerspective gives a good overview:  
      
    Here is how the content of the version 66.0 looked like:
  
    As you can see, the Facebook.app has been completely restructured:  
    One of the reason the app size grew is due to multiple copies of the same resources inside the app.  
    You can actually see in the previous screenshot 3 copies of the same file unetshallow_init.pb:  
      
    Keeping only one copy would save 7.2 MB.  
    Similarly the DataFiles folder appears 3 times. Keeping a single copy would save around 2 MB:  
      
    Some resources called FBFacecastTipJarResources appear to be duplicated no less than 6 times in the app! The FBFacecastTipJarResources resources only take 150 KB on disk but 6 times makes 900 KB.  
    One example:  
    There are a bunch of other duplicated resources, amongst them:  
    These listed resources count for 15.5 MB. By removing the duplicated resources, you could save at least 10 MB.  
    The Facebook.app contains 3 assets.car files:  
      
    All the 1972 images in FBSharedFramework are inside the main Assets.car and also part of the FBNotOnStartupPathFramework Assets.car. So there are 3 times the same 1972 images taking 3 x 9.5 MB = 28.5 MB.  
    Keeping a single set of these 1972 images would save 19 MB.  
    The remaining images in the main Assets.car (2267 - 1972 = 295) and in the FBNotOnStartupPathFramework Assets.car (2126 - 1972 = 154) are unique.  
    The Facebook.app gained 5 new localizations, increasing the app size by 4.2 MB:  
    Also each localization got a new 12 KB file called AdsCountriesConfig.json. This adds 336 KB.  
    When analyzing the version 66.0 I completely missed some amusing Objective-C interfaces, protocols and methods:  
    @protocol FBDeprecatedAppModule_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED  
    @protocol FBLoginFacilitatingAppModule   
    @interface FBTimelineModule : FBNativeAppModule_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED  
    @interface FBNotificationsModule : FBNativeAppModule_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED  
    @interface FBProductionLockoutModule : FBNativeAppModule_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED  
    @interface FBSearchModule : FBNativeAppModule_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED  
    …  
    Although the main binary is much smaller than the App Review limitation, the Facebook.app still uses a __RODATA segment containing sections generally found inside the __TEXT segment. For more information about it, please look at the previous post https://blog.timac.org/2016/1018-analysis-of-the-facebook-app-for-ios.  
    Between version 66.0 and 87.0, the Facebook.app has been completely restructured. The main -and only- binary has been split in several frameworks.  
    It appears however that during this process a couple of resources have been unnecessarily duplicated:  
    Removing the duplicated resources would save at least 40 MB. This partially explains why the app size has increased by 90 MB.  
    Update 15.04.2017: Facebook.app for iOS [v. 88.0] cleans up duplicates
